- 👋 Hi, I’m @SandyFlagg
- 👀 I’m interested in Music and Marketing.
- 🌱 Currently expanding my skillset in coding through Codecademy, improving my Spanish, and taking an Excel course to enhance my analytical capabilities.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that bridge the gap between music and marketing.
- 📫 Reach out via LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com/in/sandyflagg) or email (sandyflagg4@gmail.com) for collaborations or conversations on our shared interests.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Growing up on a secluded country farm managing 5000 lambs, I turned my boredom into creativity by learning to make music.
